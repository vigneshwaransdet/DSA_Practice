     * Question : Two Sum Problem
     *
     * 1. Do I understand the problem? -> Yes
     * 		-> 1.a) what is the input? -> int array[1,2,3,5,6] , int target = 8
     * 		-> 1.b) what is the expected output? ->  indices [1,4]
     * 		-> 1.c) Do I have constraints to solve the problem? -> based on the interviewer
     * 		-> 1.d) Do I have all the informations to go to next step? -> yes
     * 		-> 1.e) How big is your test data set will be? -> 1 set
     * 2. Test Data Set
     * 		Positive -> int[] arr = {1,3,5,6,8}, target = 11 => Output : indices [2,3]
     * 		Negative -> int[] arr = {1,3,5,6,8}, target = 11 => Output : indices [2,3] // doubt
     * 		Edge -> int[] arr = {1,3,5,6,8}, target = 11 => Output : indices [2,3] // doubt
     *
     * 3. Do I know how to solve it?
     * 		yes -> Is there an alternate? -> No
     * 		No -> Break down the problem into subproblems
     * 4. Ask for hint
     * 5. Do I know alternate solutions as well?
     * 		yes -> what are those?
     * 		No -> Brute Force
     * 6. If you know the alternate solutions?
     * Find out the 'O' notations
     * Then explain either both or the best
     * Approach 1: Start with worst -> Using Brute Force
     * Approach 2: Write down the options and the benefits of the code
     *
     * 7. Pseudo Code
     * 		-> Input : int array[1,2,3,5,6], int target = 8
     * 		-> Output : sum of two indices matching with target
     * 		-> Expectation : [1,4]
     * 		-> Traverse through the each element in the first input
     * 		-> Traverse through the following element (after the current index)
     * 		-> Compare the value of sum with the target
     * 				a) If it matches, return the index
     *		-> If none of the matches (after the loop), return the negative!
     *
